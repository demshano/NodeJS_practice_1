											Node js
											
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers 
to run JavaScript code on the server instead of in a web browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript 
engine, which is developed by Google and is known for its high performance. Node.js 
provides a platform for building scalable and efficient network applications, 
making it particularly well-suited for developing web servers, APIs, and other networked software.


Here are some key features and characteristics of Node.js:

Asynchronous and Non-blocking: 
Node.js is designed to handle asynchronous operations efficiently. 
It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means it can handle multiple requests and 
connections simultaneously without waiting for one to finish before processing the next. This makes 
it highly suitable for applications with a large number of concurrent connections, such as real-time 
web applications and chat applications.

JavaScript Runtime: 
Node.js uses JavaScript as its programming language, making it possible to use the same language 
on both the client and server sides of a web application. This can simplify development and allow
 developers to share code between the frontend and backend.

NPM (Node Package Manager): 
Node.js comes with a built-in package manager called npm, which is one of the largest software registries 
in the world. Developers can easily install and manage third-party libraries and packages using npm, 
making it straightforward to integrate external functionality into their applications.

Cross-Platform: 
Node.js is available on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a 
cross-platform development platform. This allows developers to write code on one platform and deploy 
it on multiple others with minimal modifications.

Large Ecosystem:
 Node.js has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that extend its functionality. 
 Some popular frameworks and libraries for building web applications with Node.js include Express.js, 
 Hapi.js, and Socket.io.

Community Support:
Node.js has a large and active community of developers and contributors who continually improve and 
update the platform. This vibrant community provides resources, documentation, and support for developers.

Node.js is commonly used for building web servers, APIs, real-time applications 
(such as chat and gaming servers), and various backend services. Its performance, scalability, 
and ease of use have made it a popular choice among developers for a wide range of server-side applications.

                                    const path = require('path)

The line of code const path = require('path') is used in a Node.js application to import the Node.js 
built-in path module and assign it to a variable named path. Let me break down what each part of this 
line does:

const: This is a keyword in JavaScript used to declare a constant variable. In this case, it's declaring 
a constant variable named path.

path: This is the name of the variable being declared. You can choose any valid variable name you like, 
but in this case, it's named path, which is a common convention when importing the path module.

require('path'): This part of the code is using the require function, which is a built-in Node.js function 
used for importing modules. In this case, it's importing the built-in path module that comes with Node.js. 
The argument 'path' inside the require function specifies the name of the module to import, which is 'path' 
in this case.

After this line of code is executed, you can use the path variable to access the functionality provided by
 the path module. The path module is used for working with file and directory paths in a cross-platform way, 
 making it easier to manipulate and navigate file system paths regardless of the underlying operating system.
